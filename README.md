## Setup for using Customer Account API (`/account` section)

### Enabled new Customer Account Experience

1. Go to your Shopify admin => Settings => Customer accounts => New customer account

### Setup public domain using ngrok

1. Setup a [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account and add a permanent domain (ie. `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.app`).
1. Install the [ngrok CLI](https://ngrok.com/download) to use in terminal
1. Start ngrok using `ngrok http --domain=<your-ngrok-domain>.app 3000`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To successfully interact with the Customer Account API routes you will need to use the ngrok domain during development instead of localhost
### Include public domain in Customer Account API settings

1. Go to your Shopify admin => `Hydrogen` or `Headless` app/channel => Customer Account API => Application setup
1. Edit `Callback URI(s)` to include `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.app/account/authorize`
1. Edit `Javascript origin(s)` to include your public domain `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.app` or keep it blank
1. Edit `Logout URI` to include your public domain `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.app` or keep it blank

### Add the ngrok domain to the CSP policy

Modify your `/app/entry.server.tsx` to allow the ngrok domain as a connect-src

```diff
-  const {nonce, header, NonceProvider} = createContentSecurityPolicy()
+  const {nonce, header, NonceProvider} = createContentSecurityPolicy({
+   connectSrc: [
+     'wss://<your-ngrok-domain>.app:*', // Your ngrok websocket domain
+   ],
+ });
```
